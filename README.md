# monitor-ccs.py
Python based monitoring of Google Chromecasts and communication via MQTT to command and control

Requires pychromecast: https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast

Requires paho-mqtt: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1


I do not remember where I got the code used to cast a file to a chromecast.  Once I figure that out I will give credit
